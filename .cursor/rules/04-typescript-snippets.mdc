# TypeScript snippets (for embedding in slides)

## Snippet hygiene
- Keep snippets **small** and focused (single concept).
- Ensure output is **deterministic** (no randomness/time unless explicitly required).
- Do not include secrets, API keys, or private endpoints.

## Readability
- Prefer clear names; add short comments when teaching a concept.
- Avoid clever one-liners that reduce comprehension for the audience.
