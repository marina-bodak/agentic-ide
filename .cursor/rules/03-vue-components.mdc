# Vue components for Slidev

## Keep components simple
- Prefer small presentational components for slides.
- Avoid global side effects; avoid long-running timers unless necessary.
- Avoid fetching network resources at runtime for demos.

## Vue 3 basics
- Use Vue 3 composition API patterns.
- Keep props explicit and typed when applicable.
- Keep styling minimal and local to the component.
