# Talk content: Agentic IDE (rules, commands, skills)

## Stay on topic
Optimize for the triad:
- **Rules**: persistent constraints/standards; where they live; how to scope with globs; always-apply vs file-scoped.
- **Commands**: repeatable workflows (“plan → implement → verify”), good defaults, safe stop conditions.
- **Skills**: reusable playbooks (inputs required, steps, verification), shareable across a team.

Avoid drifting into:
- Model internals, benchmarks, or vendor shootouts.
- Generic “LLMs can do anything” content without guardrails.

## Engineer-friendly framing
- Use concrete examples: “Here’s the rule text / command flow / skill structure.”
- Prefer checklists, diff-based verification, and realistic failure modes.
- Every section should answer: **what it is**, **when to use**, **how to adopt**, **how to verify**.

## Timeboxing
- 20 minutes total; each section should be skimmable and demo-forward.
- If adding slides, keep text minimal and move detail into speaker notes.
