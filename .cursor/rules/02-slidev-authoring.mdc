# Slidev authoring conventions

## Structure
- Keep slide content **tight** (bullets, short headings). Put detail in speaker notes.
- Speaker notes: use the final HTML comment block on a slide (`<!-- ... -->`).
- Prefer diagrams that explain workflows (agent loop; where rules/commands/skills plug in).

## Code and examples
- Prefer **small, copyable** snippets and diffs over long blocks.
- Any code shown should be deterministic and runnable (or clearly marked as pseudo-code).

## Demo friendliness
- Design slides so you can switch from live demo to “demo-as-diff-walkthrough” instantly.
- Avoid slides that depend on internet connectivity.
