# Safety and verification (always)

## Default workflow
- Start with a **brief plan** before making changes when the task is non-trivial.
- Keep changes **scoped** to the user request; avoid drive-by refactors.
- Prefer **small diffs**; explain tradeoffs when there are multiple options.

## Verification-first
- When changing code/content, verify with the most relevant check(s):
  - For Slidev: `npm run dev` for preview; `npm run build` before sharing final.
  - For snippets/components: ensure examples are deterministic and copyable.
- Use **diff review** as the contract: summarize what changed and why.

## Safety boundaries
- Never add or expose secrets (tokens, keys). Don’t paste private data into prompts.
- Avoid writing to ignored files; avoid generating large opaque artifacts.
- Do not change Git history, create commits, or push unless the user explicitly asks.
